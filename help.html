<h3>Jade &mdash; JAvascript Design Environment</h3>

<p><b>Quick start</b>

<ul>
<li>Browse to <A href="https://6004.mit.edu/jade">https://6004.mit.edu/jade</A> (need MIT certificate)
<li>Tool tips, etc., appear in status bar below the diagram
<li>Click on <i class="fa fa-fw fa-file-o"></i>, select "Edit module". Type
"user:foo" followed by Enter.  Modules names have the form <i>library</i>:<i>module</i>.
<li>Click and drag a couple of components from the parts bin.  You can move components
by clicking and dragging them to a new location.  You can select multiple components by
clicking on the background and dragging out a selection rectangle.
<li>Delete selected components by typing DEL
<li>There's a clipboard, accessible via <i class="fa fa-fw fa-cut"></i>, <i class="fa fa-fw fa-copy"></i>, <i class="fa fa-fw fa-paste"></i>
<li>Rotate/flip selected components using <i class="fa fa-fw fa-arrows-h"></i>, <i class="fa fa-fw fa-arrows-v"></i>, <i class="fa fa-fw fa-rotate-right"></i>, <i class="fa fa-fw fa-rotate-left"></i>
<li>Double click a component to edit its properties
<li>Add wires by clicking on the open circle at component terminals or
ends of wires, drag to create a wire
<li>You can associate a signal name with a wire either by connecting it to a named
port component or by double-clicking the wire.  Wires with the same signal name are
considered electrically connected.
<li>There is undo/redo support using <i class="fa fa-fw fa-reply"></i>, <i class="fa fa-fw fa-share"></i>
<li>Saves are automatic (every 25 edits, when changing modules or when leaving
the browser window).  The server knows who you are from your MIT certificate.
<li>To toggle the diagram grid for screen shots of schematics: Click on <i class="fa fa-fw fa-file-o"></i>, select "Toggle grid"
</ul>

<p><b>Overview</b>

<p>Jade provides a framework for editing and simulating hierarchical
block diagrams.  The editing and simulation tools are provided by
plug-ins, so it's easy extend the framework to support different
types of diagrams.

<p>The basic building block is a <i>module</i>, which are organized
into <i>libraries</i>.  Each module has one or more <i>aspects</i>,
which can be edited using one of the supplied editing tools.
Currently Jade has editors for the following aspects:

<ul>
<p><b>Electrical schematics</b>.  A circuit diagram incorporating
components (instances of other modules) with wires that run between
the component terminals.  Basic components (ground, vdd, ports,
jumpers, text) are available on the toolbar; other components from
the loaded libraries are available in the parts bin.  The toolbar
also has icons for the simulation tools (dc analysis, ac analysis,
transient analysis and module test).  It's possible
to specify that the parts bin show only particular parts and the
toolbar show only a subset of the tools.

<p><b>Icons</b>.  When a schematic contains an instance of a module as
a component, what appears in the diagram is the module's icon, usually
a simple shape representing the component's functionality along with
terminals that allow connections to be made to the component's ports.

<p><b>Properties</b>.  Modules have properties (key:value pairs) that
further specify the behavior of a module, e.g., the resistor module
has a "resistance" property specifying the component's resistance.
Properties have default values, which can be overriden for each
instance of the module.

<p><b>Test</b>.  The test tool runs a simulation, providing a
sequence of values for module's inputs and verifying that the
expected values appear on the module's outputs.  The test aspect
provides the information needed to run the test.
